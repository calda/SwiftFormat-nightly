# SwiftFormat-nightly

Nightly releases of the [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) tool's [`develop`](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/commits/develop/) branch.

Nightly builds are subject to breaking changes.

### Why?

SwiftFormat development happens on the `develop` branch. Commit SHAs on `develop` are unstable since that branch is occassionally rebased.

Nightly release URLs and tags in this repo are stable and can be referenced from other repos or tools.
